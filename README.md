# Creating-APIs
*Here, I have created RESTFUL backend API endpoints using Golang and mongodb Atlas. Initially I created it for Golang and then integrated it with the mongodb driver and connected it to my mongodb Atlas cluster. Some screenshots of testing using Postman are in the Screenshots folder. The various API endpoints are as follows:*

- "/users", Method: "POST" , Function: Creates a new user. Id is generated by mongodb, and password hashing has been implemented using bcrypt algorithm
- "/users/<insert-the-user-id>", Method: "GET", Function: Gets the user if the ID exists
- "/posts", Method: "POST", Function: Creates a new post
- "/posts/<insert-the-post-id>", Method: "GET", Function: Gets the post if the ID exists
- "/posts/users/<insert-the-post-id>", Method: "GET", Function: Gets all posts associated with an userID if it exists
  
### Steps to run your own go project
1. Download and install Golang from here - https://golang.org/doc/install
2. Create a new git repository
3. Initialise your project by writing in command line (in your local project directory)
  ```
  $ go mod init github.com/{your-github-username}/{your-repo-name}
  ```
4. Create your Go project directory and create the {main}.go file
5. Write your executable code by including package main, and Run it ((in the same directory, either through IDE or Cmd)) using
  ```
  $ go run .
  ```

# Creating-APIs
*Here, I have created RESTFUL backend API endpoints using Golang and mongodb Atlas. Initially I created it for Golang and then integrated it with the mongodb driver and connected it to my mongodb Atlas cluster. The various API endpoints are as follows:*

1. "/users", Method: "POST" , Function: Creates a new user. Id is generated by mongodb, and password hashing has been implemented using bcrypt algorithm
2. "/users/<insert-the-user-id>", Method: "GET", Function: Gets the user if the ID exists
3. "/posts", Method: "POST", Function: Creates a new post
4. "/posts/<insert-the-post-id>", Method: "GET", Function: Gets the post if the ID exists
5. "/posts/users/<insert-the-post-id>", Method: "GET", Function: Gets all posts associated with an userID if it exists

### Steps to run your own go project
- Download and install Golang from here - https://golang.org/doc/install
- Create a new git repository
- Initialise your project by writing in command line (in your local project directory)
- $ go mod init github.com/{your-github-username}/{your-repo-name}
- Create your Go project directory and create the {main}.go file
- Write your executable code by including package main, and Run it ((in the same directory, either through IDE or Cmd)) using
- $ go run .
